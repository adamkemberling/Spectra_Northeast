## Storycrafting - Northeast Shelf Spectra

>I think we need to step back a bit and find the main story again--which is about how size structure of the NES fish community has changed over time, whether that varies by region, and what covariates are associated with those changes.  
The [Aug draft you developed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bOIdQgFZbUavtBXPf570ATz9VjpjVX9Ki5hOqVw71CI/edit) really focused on [comparing regression models to consider drivers based on the fish community size spectrum](https://adamkemberling.github.io/Spectra_Northeast/Code/R/modeling/lm_models/lm_summary_materials.html) as viewed from the perspective of the Wigley species set vs. the full species set.  
However, I didn't see figures of those spectra in that draft (maybe there are somewhere else and I've lost track).  The recent slide deck really focuses on seasonal differences in the size spectra and influence of temperature.  - KMills

## Starting from Square Uno

> I'd like for us to start by rebuilding the story of how the size structure has changed over time and regional differences.  
As such, I would like for us to look at plots of the size spectrum slope for (1) the all-species length spectrum and (2) the Wigley species biomass spectrum from annual, seasonal and regional perspectives.  
I am thinking this would be two panel plots (all-spp length, Wigley-spp biomass) with 5 subpanels each (NES, GOM, GB, SNE, MAB) that are set up to show lines by seasonal and annual time steps, much like the plot on the right of slide 7 in your most recent slide deck...except with NES added and an annual line added.  Keeping the significant trend lines in is helpful.  This is the first step, so when you have that ready, please share it with the group.  - KMills

#### Aside: Biomass in Each Community

A couple things have started to catch my eye the more I've thought about volatility in these numbers. 

There seem to be two situations happening on occassion. The first is more common in GOM+GB, and that is a 5-10cm drop in median length. This sudden drop in size I am imagining is likely due to surges in new recruits.

The other patttern which is more common in MAB but looks like it happens a handful of times in GB is the reverse situation, where median size surges upward in isolated years. For these situations I think we likely could trace these down to exceptionally high catches of larger species like elasmobranchs.


## Summary of Trends


> Let's start with these pieces, and we can then discuss doing something with the extremes of the size distribution--changes in small vs. large individuals, where we pre-define size bins as you've done in slides 7 and 8, or perhaps using an approach similar to Lora's approach of defining the upper/lower percentiles of size. - KMillz



## Relationships to Temperature and Landings

The following plots and summaries will relate the Wigley species spectra to Temperature and Live Landings

```{r}

# # data limited community
wigley_bmspectra_model_df <- read_csv(here::here("Data/model_ready/wigley_community_bmspectra_mod.csv"))

# Use one for plots
wigley_bmspectra_model_df <- wigley_bmspectra_model_df %>% 
  mutate(survey_area = case_when(
    survey_area == "GoM" ~ "Gulf of Maine",
    survey_area == "GB" ~ "Georges Bank",
    survey_area == "SNE" ~ "Southern New England",
    survey_area == "MAB" ~ "Mid-Atlantic Bight"),
  survey_area = factor(survey_area, levels = area_levels_long),
  season = fct_rev(season))

```


###  Bottom Temperature Changes

Bottom temperatures have increased in all four regions. The distribution of seasonal bottom temperatures are such that Gulf of Maine experiences a much smaller difference in seasonal temperature swings than the other regions.

```{r}
temp1 <- wigley_bmspectra_model_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(est_year, bot_temp, color = season)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.8, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_ma(size = 1, n = 5, ma_fun = SMA, linetype = 1) +
  scale_color_gmri() + 
  facet_wrap(~survey_area, ncol = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(suffix = "\u00b0C")) +
  labs(y = "Bottom Temperature", x = "Year", color = "5-Year Smooth")


# Plot the distribution as a raincloud plot
temp2 <- wigley_bmspectra_model_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_rev(survey_area), bot_temp, color = season, fill = season)) +
   ggdist::stat_halfeye(
     alpha = 0.4,
     adjust = .5, 
     width = .6, 
    .width = 0, 
    justification = -.2, 
    point_colour = NA
  ) + 
  geom_boxplot(
    fill = "transparent",
    width = .15, 
    outlier.shape = NA
  ) +
  ## add dot plots from {ggdist} package
  ggdist::stat_dots(
    ## orientation to the left
    side = "left", size = 1,
    ## move geom to the left
    justification = 1.12, 
    ## adjust grouping (binning) of observations 
    binwidth = .25
  ) + 
  # geom_point(
  #   ## draw horizontal lines instead of points
  #   shape = 95,
  #   size = 10,
  #   alpha = .1) +
  scale_color_gmri() + 
  scale_fill_gmri() + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(suffix = "\u00b0C")) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y = "Bottom Temperature", x = "", color = "Season")

temp1 | temp2
```


The overlap in bottom temperature distributions is very similar to the overlap in mass spectra exponents.


```{r}
#| label: comparison across regions


wigley_b_dist_plot <- wigley_bmspectra_model_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_rev(survey_area), b, color = season, fill = season)) +
  ggdist::stat_halfeye(
     alpha = 0.4,
     adjust = .5, 
     width = .6, 
    .width = 0, 
    justification = -.2, 
    point_colour = NA) + 
  geom_boxplot(
    fill = "transparent",
    width = .15, 
    outlier.shape = NA) +
  ## add dot plots from {ggdist} package
  ggdist::stat_dots(
    ## orientation to the left
    side = "left", size = 1,
    ## move geom to the left
    justification = 1.12, 
    ## adjust grouping (binning) of observations 
    binwidth = .005) + 
  scale_color_gmri() + 
  scale_fill_gmri() + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    y = "ISD Exponent", 
    x = "",
    title = "Individual Body Mass Distribution (1g - Max)")



# Plot next to bottom temperatures
wigley_b_dist_plot | temp2
```

Which makes me lean towards thinking that the size distribution is responsive to the ambient water temperatures, and perhaps less stationary and responsive to long-term trends in some area.


```{r}
wigley_bmspectra_model_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(bot_temp, b)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = season, shape = survey_area)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black") +
  scale_color_gmri() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_number(suffix = deg_c)) +
  labs(title = "Broad Relationship to Ambient Bottom Temperature")
```


### Total Landings

```{r}
wigley_bmspectra_model_df %>% 
  distinct(est_year, survey_area, total_weight_lb) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(est_year, total_weight_lb/1e6)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_ma(aes(color = "5-Year Smooth"), size = 1, n = 5, ma_fun = SMA, linetype = 1) +
  scale_color_manual(values = "orange") +
  facet_wrap(~survey_area, ncol = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(suffix = "M")) +
  labs(y = "Total Landings (live lb.)", x = "Year", color = "Moving Average")
```

## Side Stories

Everything below is digging into different nuances of the approach or the community composition. These things are of secondary importance and will be moved out.

### Spiny Dogfish Sensitivity

Spiny dogfish constitute a large majority fraction of biomass in the MAB during the Spring survey. Their numbers have also been increasing over time. This acts to shallow the spectra as they are one of the larger species routinely sampled by the trawl survey.

If we remove them from the estimation and re-run the slopes this is what changes. 

How much can one species shift the spectra, and is this a definitive/conclusive proof that its the dogfish shallowing the slope in MAB?

```{r}

### Large Fish Index

When I looked at large/small fish indices I looked at two metrics:

 - The large fish index (proportion of yearly biomass totals represented by fishes in top 5-10% of body sizes) 

We will focus on the former for the plots below. Fish size for the below plots will be based on length because these are measured for all individuals.

Large fish will be considered anything over 55cm, representing the 90th percentile. Values are the fraction of total bodymass for a given season that is coming from the large fishes.

The fraction of the biomass held in fishes larger than 55cm is lower in the two northern areas, and falling across both seasons. In SNE its declining in the spring, and in the MAB its increasing.

### Story Thoughts

Below is a table of some papers operating in the same area or around the same topic that are particularly relevant:

```{r}
shelf_papers <- tribble(
  ~"Author", ~"Year", ~"Conjecture",
  "Friedland et al.", 2024, "Body size has declined despite more abundance & biomass. Competition is preventing larger sizes.",
  "Krumsick", 2020, "Empirical slopes from trawl survey in labrador sea were steeper than theoretical from nitrogen stable isotope ratios"
)


shelf_papers %>% gt()
```


There are a couple core ideas about what changes have occurred or have been ocurring over the Northeast Shelf with relevance to the community that is sampled by the trawl survey:


__________________


# Methodology Hangups (New)

I had for a while lacked confidence that the values we have for slopes because I was fixated on a perceived poor fit of actual data to the presumed distributions and the potential mis-application of an assumed pareto distribution.

I have also struggled with what these "faceless" values represent, and whether or not they were some meaningful feature of the community. When feeling unconfident or cynical I worried that we were looking at local changes in slope over some finite range of body-sizes and that this had less meaning than what has been ascribed to it.
 
I also don't know whether slopes are comparable across regions. And if we should be fixing the size-range parameters consistently across groups to allow cross comparison, or let them shift to better fit each seasonal subset. 
Keeping with the original 1g minimum size parameterization. We see these distributions in the wigley species bodymass spectra:
 

```{r}

wigley_b_dist_plot <- wigley_bmspectra_model_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_rev(survey_area), b, color = season, fill = season)) +
  ggdist::stat_halfeye(
     alpha = 0.4,
     adjust = .5,

    point_colour = NA) + 
  geom_boxplot(
    fill = "transparent",
    width = .15, 
    outlier.shape = NA) +
  ## add dot plots from {ggdist} package
  ggdist::stat_dots(
    ## orientation to the left
    side = "left", size = 1,
    ## move geom to the left
    justification = 1.12, 
    ## adjust grouping (binning) of observations 
    binwidth = .005) +

  scale_fill_gmri() +

### Thoughts on Min/Max Parameters

Our change in growth and fisheries removal hypotheses both relate primarily to abundance of non-age0 fishes. 

It might make sense if that is where we are focused to move the minimum size up to something larger and minimize the impact poorly selected size classes and large recruitment events have on the community distribution. 

This will accomplish two things: 1) lower any noise in median size or spectra slope that results from large recruit cohorts & 2) help ensure that the size range we're estimating spectra for are fully selected by the gear.

Currently a 1g minimum size is likely lower than the mesh size selectivity. 

This section from Krumsick 2024 describes how this has been handled previously
> To account for reduced catchability of small fish,past size-
spectrum studies have typically only used size frequency data
for size classes larger than the peak size class in observed data
(i.e. the descending slope of the observed size-abundance re-
lationship) when estimating the slope of sizespectra (e.g.Rice
and Gislason 1996, Daan et al. 2005, Krumsick and Fisher
2020).

The following table is a short collection of how authors who cited edwards treated this step:

#### Log2 Binned Bodymass Distribution

The following plot shows what the distribution looks like for all data (years, seasons, areas) over the range of sizes we are allowing to contribute to the estimation of seasonal spectra. The data are binned into log2 increments. This isn't the same method we are using for slope estimates, but at an aggregate level like this it is an un-biased approximator of the individual size distribution.

I've highlighted where a minimum body size of 1g sits on this curve to mark where it sits. If the data from the survey were following a pareto distribution over the full range in sizes I would anticipate successive bins to decline, and not increase or remain level for several size ranges to eventually begin declining.

We could probably be more scientific than visually picking the inflection point and look at the mesh size used (codend liner 1 inch stretched diamond mesh), but I think precision there is less important that being closer than we are now. In all regions it seems like the typical linear slope begins at a larger size than 1g. 




#### Log2 Binned Length Distributions

The length distributions look even more flat than the biomass distributions, basically ending at the 128-256cm bin. If we go with the Full finfish community we may want to look more closely at the max-size parameter.

Here is what the length distirbution looks like for the broader finfish community:

## Is it even Pareto?


I still have some concerns about this, but I think I'm mostly over it and we don't have time or a plan to check and address them. 

This section from Edwards 2007 alludes to the ongoing debate on appropriateness of applying size spectra methods to empirical data.

> The MLE method avoids binning and regression. Binning in general can be problematic (e.g. if a data set has no body masses <10 g but the lowest bin is defined as 8–16 g), and the choice of bin widths can affect the estimated slope (Vidondo et al. 1997). Regression-based methods are problematic because the intercept and the slope implicitly determine urn:x-wiley:2041210X:media:mee312641:mee312641-math-0064, which can erroneously be greater than some data values (James, Plank & Edwards 2011). They also assume that the errors in the logarithmic counts for each bin have the same variance, which may not be justified. Although regression can be understood in a likelihood context, this is different to explicitly using a likelihood-based method (Edwards et al. 2012).

Other authors have raised this issue, but there is no clear advisement on how to assess/approach situations where the pareto or power law distributions are not appropriate. In Krumsick et al. 2020 they determined visually that their data from the trawl data did not follow the distribution assumed by the MLE methodology and instead turned to normalized spectra using binned methods.


# What if we shifted minimum size to 16g?

I'm just going to go ahead and shift the minimum size cutoff to 16g and see what the consequences are:

After doing some attempts to plot the impacts of moving it around, I am less convinced that its necessary, though it does result in steeper slopes over these sizes.

### Across Group Difference Consequences

One of the original hypotheses was that under warming the size distribution in the Northern, colder regions would begin to resemble the size distributions of more southern, warmer regions.

Whether or not we shift the size range, the distributions seem similarly distinct.

To be directly comparable I had thought it might be important to restrict the range of sizes that we consider when estimating the exponent of the individual size distribution.

### Size Ranges Covered by ISD Fitting

Before I plotted the distributions of exponent values before/after shifting minimum size, I was concerned about the absolute values shifting in a meaningful way. 

I'm less concerned now, but the range of sizes spanneed in the MAB seem much larger than the other regions.

The below plot shows the variance in min-max size ranges for the size distribution fits. There is a much larger range in the Mid-Atlantic. 

We may want to drop some outliers there to be more consistent in the range of sizes we are comparing.

### Visualizing Size Distribution "Fits"

I found the bug that made the fits look strange, I was fitting length spectra and then plotting mass points.

The following plots will go over the consequences of changing min/max limits when fitting the ISD for Mid-Atlantic Bight in Fall of 1976, a year with an exceptionally hefty individual that drags the size range to an extreme.


```{r}
#| label: testing-pareto-fits


# Prepare inputs directly:
yr_op <- c(1976)
reg   <- "MAB"
seas  <- "Fall"


# Data for the spectra
actual_vals_1g <- wigley_in %>%
  filter(
    est_year %in% yr_op,
    survey_area == reg,
    season == seas,
    wmin_g >= 1)

# Filtered to above 16g
actual_vals_16g <- wigley_in %>%
  filter(
    est_year %in% yr_op,
    survey_area == reg,
    season == seas,
    wmin_g >= 16)

# Filtered to above 16g, below 50kg
actual_vals_16to50kg <- wigley_in %>%
  filter(
    est_year %in% yr_op,
    survey_area == reg,
    season == seas,
    wmin_g >= 16, 
    wmax_g <= 50000)
```


## Sensitivity to minimum/maximum size

Even when shifting the minimum size, its not clear that the size distribution now follows the pareto distribution more closely. 

Its easier to quickly look at the binned versions, but then we're hopping across methods again.

I tracked down the plotting bug, but its still likely not something we can allocate resources to worrying about.

#### 16g up-to 50kg


There are a couple different implementations of how to enforce a max size. One is to pre-filter the data, and allow the parameter to be the largest size still. Another would be to filter the data AND set the max-size parameter for the ISD estimation. The latter would lock in the same parameter value for all fits, the former would.

For the following plot I've filtered the input data to below 50kg, and then allowed the largest size present set the parameter `xmax`.
