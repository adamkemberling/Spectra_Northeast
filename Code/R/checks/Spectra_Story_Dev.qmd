## Storycrafting - Northeast Shelf Spectra

>I think we need to step back a bit and find the main story again--which is about how size structure of the NES fish community has changed over time, whether that varies by region, and what covariates are associated with those changes.  
The [Aug draft you developed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bOIdQgFZbUavtBXPf570ATz9VjpjVX9Ki5hOqVw71CI/edit) really focused on [comparing regression models to consider drivers based on the fish community size spectrum](https://adamkemberling.github.io/Spectra_Northeast/Code/R/modeling/lm_models/lm_summary_materials.html) as viewed from the perspective of the Wigley species set vs. the full species set.  
However, I didn't see figures of those spectra in that draft (maybe there are somewhere else and I've lost track).  The recent slide deck really focuses on seasonal differences in the size spectra and influence of temperature.  - KMills

This document will be split into two sections (the second potentially moving to its own doc). 


# Part 1: Summary of Trends

For the first section the focus is on understanding changes in the size structure. This will be done using length and bodymass spectra, large and small fish indices, and looking at how body mass size quantiles have moved over time.

This section should address: Has the size distribution changed over time, where has it changed, and some nuance around what aspects about the distribution have shifted.


## Starting from Square Uno

> I'd like for us to start by rebuilding the story of how the size structure has changed over time and regional differences.  
As such, I would like for us to look at plots of the size spectrum slope for (1) the all-species length spectrum and (2) the Wigley species biomass spectrum from annual, seasonal and regional perspectives.  
I am thinking this would be two panel plots (all-spp length, Wigley-spp biomass) with 5 subpanels each (NES, GOM, GB, SNE, MAB) that are set up to show lines by seasonal and annual time steps, much like the plot on the right of slide 7 in your most recent slide deck...except with NES added and an annual line added.  Keeping the significant trend lines in is helpful.  This is the first step, so when you have that ready, please share it with the group.  - KMills

wigley_in <- read_csv(here::here("Data/processed/wigley_species_trawl_data.csv"))
finfish_in <- read_csv(here::here("Data/processed/finfish_trawl_data.csv"))
```

#### Aside: Biomass Fraction in Each Community

If we need to make a decision about which community we want to use, here is the different biomass totals for each:


```{r}
# glimpse(wigley_in)

# Load raw
# General tidying only, removal of strata outside our study area, Spring and Fall only
# (removes inshore and rarely/inconsistently sampled strata etc.)
# shrimps removed
trawl_basic <- read_csv(here::here("Data/processed/trawl_clean_all_data.csv"))

# Biomass totals
raw_totals <- trawl_basic %>% 
  distinct(est_towdate, cruise6, station, stratum, tow, comname,  biomass_kg) %>%   pull(biomass_kg) %>% 
  sum()

wig_biomass_total <- wigley_in %>% 
  distinct(est_towdate, cruise6, station, stratum, tow, comname,  biomass_kg) %>%   pull(biomass_kg) %>% 
  sum()

ffish_biomass_total <- finfish_in %>% 
  distinct(est_towdate, cruise6, station, stratum, tow, comname,  biomass_kg) %>%   pull(biomass_kg) %>% 
  sum()

# Make a table for display
tibble(
  "Community" = c("All (including crustaceans)", "All finfish", "Wigley Species Subset"),
  "Biomass Total" = c(raw_totals, ffish_biomass_total, wig_biomass_total)) %>% 
  mutate(`% of Total` = (`Biomass Total` / raw_totals)*100) %>% 
  gt()

```

**Notes:**

There are a number of years when median weight surges in MAB. For these situations I think we likely could trace these down to exceptionally high catches of larger species like elasmobranchs.

We also don't see a shelf-wide decline in size so I might need to check what Friedland did or prepare for a confrontation.


## C. Small/Large Fish Trends (True Percentiles)

Data for part C. comes from the Wigly species subset to set percentiles based on individual bodymass.

The following figures frame "large fish" as individuals with bodymass greater than the 90th percentile for all years within that region. "Small fish" are considered smaller than the 10th percentile of the mass distribution.

The following table shows what those percentiles are for each region. 

**NOTE:**
Percentiles are determined using `DescTools::Quantile()` which uses `numlen_adj` to weight everything by abundance.


```{r}
#| label: weighted percentiles

# # Get 95th percentile as threshold
# DescTools::Quantile(
#   wigley_in$length_cm, 
#   weights = wigley_in$numlen_adj, 
#   probs = c(0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 0.90, .95)) %>% 
#   t() %>% 
#   as_tibble()


# Do them separately
area_size_quants <- bind_rows(
    mutate(wigley_in, survey_area = "Northeast Shelf"),
    wigley_in) %>% 
  split(.$survey_area) %>% 
  map_dfr(function(x,y){
    
    DescTools::Quantile(
      # x$length_cm, 
      x$ind_weight_kg,
      weights = x$numlen_adj, 
      probs = c(0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 0.90, .95)) %>% 
      t() %>% 
      as_tibble() 
  }, .id = "survey_area") %>% 
  mutate(survey_area = factor(survey_area, levels = area_levels_all)) %>% 
  arrange(survey_area)

# Show the table
area_size_quants %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2) %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header(title = "Wigley Species - Body Mass Quantiles (kg)") %>% tab_spanner(label = "Percentile", columns = -survey_area) %>% 
  cols_label("survey_area" = "")

```


```{r}
#| label: assign large and small labels


##### Large Fish Index  ####


# Assign large/small
wigley_in <- wigley_in %>% 
  left_join(select(area_size_quants, survey_area, `10%`, `90%`)) %>%   
  mutate(
    small = ifelse(ind_weight_kg < `10%`, T, F),
    large = ifelse(ind_weight_kg > `90%`, T, F))



# Get total abundance
total_abundbio <- bind_rows(
    mutate(wigley_in, survey_area = "Northeast Shelf"),
    wigley_in) %>% 
  group_by(survey_area, est_year, season) %>% 
  summarise(
    total_abund = sum(numlen_adj),
    total_bio = sum(sum_weight_kg),
    .groups = "drop")
  
  
# Get large fish bio
lf_abundbio <- bind_rows(
    mutate(wigley_in, survey_area = "Northeast Shelf"),
    wigley_in) %>% 
  group_by(survey_area, est_year, season) %>% 
  summarise(
    small_abund = sum(numlen_adj * small),
    small_bio = sum(sum_weight_kg * small),
    large_abund = sum(numlen_adj * large),
    large_bio = sum(sum_weight_kg * large),
    .groups = "drop")

# Join and divide
lfi <- left_join(total_abundbio, lf_abundbio) %>% 
  mutate(
    LFI = large_abund / total_abund,
    SFI = small_abund / total_abund)  %>% 
  mutate(survey_area = factor(survey_area, levels = area_levels_all)) %>% 
  left_join(
    select(area_size_quants, survey_area, `10%`, `90%`) %>% 
      mutate(across(-survey_area, \(x) str_c(round(x, 2), " kg"))))
```

The following species are those which has representation in the large fish index:

You might think: "Why is a 1kg acadian redfish a "large fish"?". That's a consequence of abundance declining with size pretty dramatically.

```{r}
big_fishes <- wigley_in %>% 
  filter(large) %>% 
  distinct(comname) %>% 
  arrange(comname) %>% 
  rename(`Common Name:` = comname) 


# Print it neatly
pander(big_fishes$`Common Name:`)

```

There's really just so few "large" individuals that the percentiles sit quite small.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4


wigley_in %>% 
  filter(ind_weight_kg <= 5) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ind_weight_g, y = ..density.., weight = numlen_adj)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "#535353", binwidth = 50 ) +
  #geom_density(color = "#EA4F12", linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Overall Bodymass Distribution for Wigley Species",
       subtitle = "Weights over 5kg removed",
       x = "Mass (g)")
```

### Shifting 10th & 90th Percentiles

A 90th percentile fish is smaller than I feel it has been in the past, so I wanted to plot those quantiles over time. 

Indeed, the 90th & 95th percentile size for fishes in the GOM was nearly 2x what it is today.

## D. 1kg Discrete Size Breaks

Due to the skewed distribution in abundance with increasing size, using percentile cutoffs leads to a situation where "large" individuals are in practice quite small.

For the plots below I took the the 1-5kg range in body weights and broke that range into five equally spaced body size ranges.

```{r}
# What percent is 5kg and smaller?
wigley_smol <- filter(wigley_in, ind_weight_kg <= 5)
smol_frac <- signif((sum(wigley_smol$numlen_adj, na.rm = T) / sum(wigley_in$numlen_adj, na.rm = T)), 3) *100


```


This still includes `smol_frac`% of the abundance for wigley species.


```{r}
#| fig-height: 3

# Do everything together
# Make evenly spaced bins
overall_weight_ranges <- seq(
      floor(min(wigley_smol$ind_weight_kg, na.rm = T)),
      ceiling(max(wigley_smol$ind_weight_kg, na.rm = T)),
      length.out = 6)
# Make that a table for plotting
overall_range_tbl <-tibble(
      "size_group" = c("S", "S-M", "M", "M-L", "L"),
      "min" = overall_weight_ranges[1:5],
      "max" = overall_weight_ranges[2:6]
    ) %>% 
  mutate(size_range = str_c(min, "-",max, "kg"))


# Plot the breaks
overall_range_tbl  %>% 
  mutate(
    size_group = factor(size_group, levels = c("S", "S-M", "M", "M-L", "L"))) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_segment(aes(x = min, xend = max, y = 0, yend = 0, color = size_group), linewidth = 14) +
  geom_point(aes(x = min, y = 0), shape = "|", size = 5) +
  geom_point(aes(x = max, y = 0), shape = "|", size = 5) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(add = c(0.001, 0.001)), labels = NULL, breaks = NULL) +
  rcartocolor::scale_color_carto_d(palette = "OrYel") +
  labs(x = "Individual Body Mass (kg)", y = "", color = "Size Range", title = "Even Breaks in Body Mass",
       subtitle = ">5kg Individuals Removed")


  
```


If we plot these 1kg bins we can see that 0-1kg individuals dominate the region.

```{r}

    size_group = case_when(

# Most abundant

### 1kg Bin Changes

How has the fraction of total abundance shifted for these weight-bins:

```{r}
ggplot(even_breaks_summary, aes(est_year, percent_abund, color = season)) +
  #geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 0.8, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_ma(size = 1, n = 5, ma_fun = SMA, linetype = 1) +
  scale_color_gmri() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent()) +
  facet_grid(size_range*size_group~survey_area, scales = "free") +
  labs(y = "% / Seasonal Abundance", x = "Year")

```

### How is Abundance Distributed?

These figures really should be standardized into some sort of CPUE to account for differences in effort and area.

```{r}
# Plot the Northeast Shelf changes
even_breaks_summary %>% 
  mutate(size_range = fct_rev(size_range)) %>% 
  filter(survey_area != "Northeast Shelf") %>% 
  mutate(area_title = "Northeast Shelf") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(est_year, total_size_abund, fill = survey_area)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack") +
  scale_fill_gmri() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::breaks_pretty(), labels = label_number(big.mark = ",") ) +
  facet_grid(size_range*size_group~area_title*season, scales = "free") +
  labs(y = "Abundance", x = "Year", fill = "Region")
```


### How is Biomass Distributed?

You can really see the jump at 2008 in these figures if you look at Spring, and at the smaller bins for Fall.

Biomass totals below are from biomass-at-length estimates*

```{r}
# Plot the Northeast Shelf changes
even_breaks_summary %>% 
  mutate(size_range = fct_rev(size_range)) %>% 
  filter(survey_area != "Northeast Shelf") %>% 
  mutate(area_title = "Northeast Shelf") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(est_year, total_size_bio, fill = survey_area)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack") +
  scale_fill_gmri() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::breaks_pretty(), labels = label_number(big.mark = ",") ) +
  facet_grid(size_range*size_group~area_title*season, scales = "free") +
  labs(y = "Biomass (kg)", x = "Year", fill = "Region")

# Summary of Trends


> Let's start with these pieces, and we can then discuss doing something with the extremes of the size distribution--changes in small vs. large individuals, where we pre-define size bins as you've done in slides 7 and 8, or perhaps using an approach similar to Lora's approach of defining the upper/lower percentiles of size. - KMillz

###  Bottom Temperature Changes

Bottom temperatures are from the DuPontavice and Saba combined bottom temperature product. This data product has been clipped to the study areas and seasonally averaged to match the survey sampling seasons.


```{r}




# Model linear trends in time
btemp_mods <- lmer(
  formula = bot_temp ~ est_year * survey_area * season + (1|est_year),
  data = wigley_bmspectra_model_df)



# change the stupid labels around because
btemp_preds <- as.data.frame(
    # Model predictions
    ggpredict(
        btemp_mods, 
        terms = ~ est_year * survey_area * season) ) %>% 
    mutate(
        survey_area = factor(group, levels = area_levels_long),
        season = factor(facet, levels = c("Spring", "Fall")))
btemp_signif <- emtrends(
      object = btemp_mods,
      specs =  ~ survey_area*season,
      var = "est_year") %>% 
      as_tibble() %>% 
      mutate(
        zero = 0,
        non_zero = if_else(between(zero, lower.CL, upper.CL), F, T))
btemp_trend_predictions <- left_join(btemp_preds, btemp_signif)  %>% 
  mutate(survey_area = group,
         survey_area = factor(survey_area, levels = area_levels_long),
         season = factor(season, levels = c("Spring", "Fall")))




# Plot temperatures
temp1 <- wigley_bmspectra_model_df %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_ribbon(
    data = filter(btemp_trend_predictions, non_zero == TRUE),
    aes(x, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high, fill = season),
    linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.35) +
  geom_point(
    aes(est_year, bot_temp, color = season),
    size = 0.8, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_ma(
    aes(est_year, bot_temp, color = season, linetype = "5-Year Smooth"),
    size = 1, n = 5, ma_fun = SMA) +
  geom_line(
    data = filter(btemp_trend_predictions, non_zero == TRUE),
    aes(x, predicted, color = season, linetype = "Significant Trend"),
    linewidth = 1, alpha = 1) +
  scale_color_gmri() + 
  scale_fill_gmri() + 
  #scale_linetype_manual(values = c(1,1)) +
  facet_grid(survey_area~., scales = "free") +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(suffix = "\u00b0C")) +
  labs(y = "Bottom Temperature", x = "Year", color = "Season",
       fill = "Season", linetype = "Trend")



temp1 
```

Bottom temperatures have increased in all four regions (annual averages), but seasonally spring temperatures in SNE and MAB are stable. 



### Bottom Temperature Distributions

The distribution of seasonal bottom temperatures are such that Gulf of Maine experiences a much smaller difference in seasonal temperature swings than the other regions. In the Gulf of Maine the difference in bottom temperature from Spring to Fall can be smaller than the differences in spring bottom temperature along the whole Northeast Shelf. 


```{r}

# Plot the distribution as a raincloud plot
wigley_bmspectra_model_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_rev(survey_area), bot_temp, color = season, fill = season)) +
   ggdist::stat_halfeye(
     alpha = 0.4,
     adjust = .5, 
     width = .6, 
    .width = 0, 
    justification = -.2, 
    point_colour = NA
  ) + 
  geom_boxplot(
    fill = "transparent",
    width = .15, 
    outlier.shape = NA
  ) +
  ## add dot plots from {ggdist} package
  ggdist::stat_dots(
    ## orientation to the left
    side = "left", size = 1,
    ## move geom to the left
    justification = 1.12, 
    ## adjust grouping (binning) of observations 
    binwidth = .1) + 
  scale_color_gmri() + 
  scale_fill_gmri() +

  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y = "Bottom Temperature", x = "", color = "Season")
```

The overlap in bottom temperature distributions is very similar to the overlap in mass spectra exponents. Gulf of Maine spectra and bottom temperatures share a good region of overlap, and the regions that experience larger seasonal fluctuations in BT see larger seasonal fluctuations in their size distributions.

# Plot next to bottom temperatures

```

This makes me lean towards belief that the size distribution is more responsive on shorter time scales to the ambient water temperatures in order to align so well with seasonal temperature swings. To me this suggests that as a whole the community is likely better equipped to respond to the long-term trends if they track larger absolute swings within the year.


```{r}
wigley_bmspectra_model_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(bot_temp, b)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = season, shape = survey_area)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam", color = "black") +
  scale_color_gmri() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_number(suffix = deg_c)) +
  labs(title = "Broad Relationship to Ambient Bottom Temperature")
```


### Total Landings

The landings information is the newer GARFO data obtained from Andy Beet. It was delivered as containing only finfish, I have removed freshwater species and blue crabs. It should largely reflect marine finfish species at this point.


```{r}
wigley_bmspectra_model_df %>% 
  distinct(est_year, survey_area, total_weight_lb) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(est_year, total_weight_lb/1e6)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_ma(aes(color = "5-Year Smooth"), size = 1, n = 5, ma_fun = SMA, linetype = 1) +
  scale_color_manual(values = "orange") +
  facet_wrap(~survey_area, ncol = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(suffix = "M")) +
  labs(y = "Total Landings (live lb.)", x = "Year", color = "Moving Average")
```

### Zooplankton Community Indices

The `ecodata` package has changed the zooplankton indices around that it carries. It now contains "regime" metrics for 26 of the main zooplankton taxa.

```{r}
zoo_regimes <- ecodata::zoo_regime
# zoo_anoms <- ecodata::zoo_abundance_anom
zoo_regimes %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Var, "calfin|chaeto|pseudo|oith")) %>% 
  mutate(EPU = factor(EPU, levels = c("GOM", "GB", "MAB"))) %>% 
ggplot(aes(Time, Value)) +
  geom_point(
    size = 0.8, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_ma(
    aes(linetype = "5-Year Smooth"),
    size = 1, n = 5, ma_fun = SMA) +
  #scale_color_gmri() +
  facet_grid(EPU~Var) +
  labs()
```

## Side Stories

Everything below is digging into different nuances of the approach or the community composition. These things are of secondary importance and will be moved out.

### Spiny Dogfish Sensitivity

Spiny dogfish constitute a large majority fraction of biomass in the MAB during the Spring survey. Their numbers have also been increasing over time. This acts to shallow the spectra as they are one of the larger species routinely sampled by the trawl survey.

If we remove them from the estimation and re-run the slopes this is what changes. 

How much can one species shift the spectra, and is this a definitive/conclusive proof that its the dogfish shallowing the slope in MAB?

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| label: spiny dogfish spectra



# # Run MAB with and without spiny dogfish
# # Run the year, season, area fits for the filtered data
# no_dogs_bmspectra <- group_binspecies_spectra(
#   ss_input = filter(wigley_in, comname != "spiny dogfish"),
#   grouping_vars = c("est_year", "season", "survey_area"),
#   abundance_vals = "numlen_adj",
#   length_vals = "length_cm",
#   use_weight = TRUE,
#   isd_xmin = 1,
#   global_min = TRUE,
#   isd_xmax = NULL,
#   global_max = FALSE,
#   bin_width = 1,
#   vdiff = 2)

# # Save those
# write_csv(
#   no_dogs_bmspectra,
#   here::here("Data/processed/wigley_species_nodogfish_bmspectra.csv"))
```


```{r}
#| eval: true

# Read them in, do some plotting
no_dogs_bmspectra <- read_csv(
  here::here("Data/processed/wigley_species_nodogfish_bmspectra.csv")) %>% 
  mutate(survey_area = factor(survey_area, levels = area_levels))


# Format a little
no_dogs_bmspectra <- no_dogs_bmspectra %>% 
  mutate(est_year = as.numeric(est_year))


# Join them together
dfish_results <- bind_rows(
   list(
     "Wigley Full" = wigley_bmspectra,
     "Wigley w/o Spiny Dogfish" =  no_dogs_bmspectra), 
   .id = "community") %>% 
  mutate(metric = "bodymass_spectra") %>% 
  mutate(
    survey_area = fct_relevel(survey_area, area_levels))

  .id = "model_id") %>% 
  separate(model_id, into = c("metric", "community"), sep = "-") %>% 
  mutate(metric = fct_rev(metric))



# Plot the differences

### Story Thoughts

Below is a table of some papers operating in the same area or around the same topic that are particularly relevant:

```{r}
shelf_papers <- tribble(
  ~"Author", ~"Year", ~"Conjecture",
  "Friedland et al.", 2024, "Body size has declined despite more abundance & biomass. Competition is preventing larger sizes.",
  "Krumsick", 2020, "Empirical slopes from trawl survey in labrador sea were steeper than theoretical from nitrogen stable isotope ratios"
)


shelf_papers %>% gt()
```


There are a couple core ideas about what changes have occurred or have been ocurring over the Northeast Shelf with relevance to the community that is sampled by the trawl survey:
